### Homework 8 (due Sunday, October 29, 2017)

1. Read Adafruit Arduino lesson 0: [Getting Started](https://learn.adafruit.com/lesson-0-getting-started?view=all). They use a different kit so don't worry about the parts they describe.  Read for the general information.

1. Read Adafruit Arduino lesson 1: [Blink](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-1-blink) -- there are several pages here, make sure to go through all of them. (We did this in class so it should be a review.)

1. Read and follow the instructions for Adafruit Arduino lesson 2: [LEDs](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-2-leds). We worked with resistors and LEDs a little bit in class, but this tutorial takes the material further.

1. In the README.md file for this week's homework GitHub repository, answer the following questions from this week's readings: 

  a. What line of code waits one and a half seconds? 

  b. Why does a resistor need an LED? 

  c. Why is a breadboard useful?

  d. Identify at least least 2 things you did not understand from the reading 

1. Complete another challenge problem from an earlier homework, and submit it in this homework assignment as `challenge.js`, making sure to indicate in a `// comment` which homework it's from and what the assignment is.
