### Homework 9 (due Tuesday, November 7, 2017)

In this week's assignment, you'll learn about `analogWrite` a bit and then complete a practice quiz. (The in-class quiz will be in two weeks during week 11, on November 15. If you already that know you won't be in class that day, please get in touch with me ASAP!)

#### Learn about `analogWrite()`

1. Read the `analogWrite()` [reference page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/AnalogWrite).

2. Optional: If you are curious about PWM read [this explanation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/PWM).

3. Make sure to keep your transistors & motors on your board, and follow [this tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/AnalogInOutSerial) to use a potentiometer to control the brightness of an LED. Upload a picture of your breadboard to GitHub.

4. Answer these questions, and upload them to your GitHub repository:

   1. Why can you only use certain pins for `analogWrite()`?

   2. What is the range the map() function maps the value to? Why this range? 
   
#### Practice Quiz

Download, print out, and complete this [practice quiz](practice-quiz.pdf). Instructions:

- The in-class examination will be open-book, open-notes, but closed-computer. (No digital devices will be allowed.) The format will be very similar to this practice quiz.

- To complete the practice quiz, take as long as you need (though be aware that we'll give you 2 hours in class), see what you can do without your computer, and use whatever notes you plan to bring. This is also a good opportunity for you to flesh out your notes if you're missing anything.

- Scan (or photograph with your cell phone) your completed practice quiz and [email it to me](mailto:jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu) (don't put this in github) by Tuesday night, 11:59pm on November 7.
