# CCA Programming & Electronics, Fall 2017

This course repository contains homework assignments, useful guides, and code for "Programming & Electronics" at CCA, Fall 2017.

Also included in this repository is the official [course syllabus](syllabus.pdf).

### Week 1: Wednesday, September 6, 2017

Lecture:
- Introductions
- What is programming?
- Goals & course details

Hands-on activities:
- Human Embodiment of Programmer & Robot
  - Programs generally run line-by-line.
  - Repetition, decision making, and recipes break that up.
- [Solving Puzzles](puzzle-sheets.pdf)

#### Building Blocks of Code

In class, we discussed the four basic building blocks of code: actions & recipes, remembering, making decisions, and repetition. 

[Here are some notes.](building-blocks-programs.md)

### Week 2: Wednesday, September 13, 2017

In-class:
- Homework review.
- Translating "pseudo-code" into real code with [Rudy](http://rudy.zamfi.net); here are some notes on the [building blocks of code](building-blocks-code.md).

[Homework for Week 2](hw/week2.md)

### Week 3: Wednesday, September 20, 2017

First, homework review. Then, a workshop.

#### Workshop

Together, we'll experiment with a few sketches to practice variables:

- [A Single Ellipse](http://p5js.zamfi.net/jd/sketches/SkPx0nSPx)
  - Working with a partner, modify this sketch to create an ellipse that extends past the edges of the canvas.
- [Random Dots](http://p5js.zamfi.net/full/HJ6LyTBPx)
  - Working with a partner, modify this sketch to give each ellipse:
     1. A random size.
     2. A random color. (Use HSB for nicer colors!)
- [Color and HSB](http://p5js.zamfi.net/full/ByanCnHPx)
  - Working with a partner, modify this sketch so that it continuously changes color instead of stopping at red.
- [Nice Little House](http://p5js.zamfi.net/full/HJRrZprPe)
  - Working with a partner, modify your house so that it is drawn at the location of your mouse, as you move the mouse. Use the `mouseX` and `mouseY` variables available to you in p5.js.
